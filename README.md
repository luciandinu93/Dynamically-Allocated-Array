# Dynamically Allocated Array in C++
First of all: I know that there is <b>std::vector</b> that does exactly that

Objective: Create a function that allocates dynamiccaly memory to an array that has the length undefined

Input: User enters the int value from keyboard until '-1' is encountered

Output: Display the array

Objective: I want to reinvent the wheel a little with the purpose of learning.

Any help is welcome :)
